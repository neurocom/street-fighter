# Mail Polling

## Decision

We have decided to implement the mail polling using Serverless Lambda Functions as the preferred approach.

## Pros

- Event-Driven and Real-Time: Serverless Lambda Functions provide an event-driven model, enabling real-time email polling as emails arrive. This eliminates the need for scheduled polling and ensures immediate response to new messages.

- Automatic Scaling: Serverless platforms, such as AWS Lambda, offer automatic scaling based on the volume of email events. This ensures that the application can handle varying workloads efficiently.

- Resource Efficiency: Lambda Functions are short-lived and consume resources only during execution, leading to cost savings and efficient resource utilization.

- Pay-as-You-Go Pricing: Serverless platforms typically follow a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing cost optimization by charging only for the actual execution time and resources used.

## Cons

    Complexity: Implementing email polling with Serverless Lambda Functions may introduce complexity in managing event-driven workflows, especially when dealing with complex email protocols and error handling.

    Function Execution Limits: Lambda Functions have execution time limits and resource constraints. Long-running email polling tasks may require careful design to fit within these constraints.

## Justification

Our decision to implement the mail polling application using Serverless Lambda Functions aligns with the modern paradigm of event-driven, efficient, and cost-effective computing. This approach allows for real-time email polling, immediate response to incoming emails, and automatic scalability, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

While some complexity may be introduced due to event-driven workflows, the advantages, including flexibility, real-time responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness, outweigh the drawbacks. Serverless Lambda Functions enable us to build a responsive and efficient email polling system that is well-suited for handling varying workloads and efficiently managing resources.
