# Web and mobile application

## Decision
In order to easier utilize each type of device we decided to have a separate applications, a web application for users accessing our platform from a browser and a mobile (native) application for mobile users.

## Pros
- Web applications can be accessed from any device and are broadly available.
- Native mobile applications can provide a more optimized and consistent experience for each platform. Also, they can offer better offline access which is highly preferable for users travelling abroad.

## Cons
- Developing and maintaining 2 separate applications is more time-consuming and increases costs.
- Synchronizing features released across both applications (web and mobile) adds complexity.

## Justification
Due to the nature of our product, we expect the majority of our users to access our application using their mobile devices.
Also, considering future needs and additional features that might be added to our product, we believe having a native mobile application is a better decision.

## Other Considerations
Native mobile apps can better utilize Geo-location data to provide location based notifications about reservation or progress of trips.
