# GDPR

The service processes personal data as part of our operations. Having an international userbase, we are committed to complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to ensure the privacy and data protection rights of individuals. This decision outlines the architectural considerations and measures to achieve GDPR compliance in our data processing activities.

## Decision:

We will implement a comprehensive set of GDPR compliance measures in our data architecture, including the following key components:

- Data Classification and Mapping: We will identify and categorize all personal data within our systems. This includes mapping the flow of personal data across data stores, applications, and processes.
- Data Minimization: Our architecture will prioritize data minimization, ensuring that only necessary personal data is collected, processed, and retained. We will regularly review and dispose of data that is no longer required for its intended purpose.
- Consent Management: For data processing activities that require user consent, we will implement a consent management system within our applications. This system will capture and manage user consent preferences and provide mechanisms for users to withdraw consent.
- Data Encryption: Personal data, both in transit and at rest, will be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms. This ensures data security and reduces the risk of data breaches.
- Access Control: Role-based access control (RBAC) and strict access policies will be enforced to limit access to personal data to authorized personnel only. Authentication and authorization mechanisms will be robust and regularly audited.
- Data Portability: Our architecture will support data portability, allowing individuals to request and receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This includes APIs and export functionality.
- Data Retention and Deletion: We will implement data retention policies and mechanisms for automatic data deletion once it reaches the end of its retention period or when requested by data subjects.
- Data Impact Assessments: We will conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) to identify and mitigate potential privacy risks associated with data processing activities, especially those involving high risks to individuals.
- Incident Response and Breach Notification: A robust incident response plan will be integrated into our architecture to detect and respond to data breaches promptly. We will also have mechanisms in place to notify both data protection authorities and affected individuals in the event of a breach.
- Privacy by Design and Default: Privacy considerations will be integrated into our system development processes, following the principles of privacy by design and default. This means that data protection will be considered at every stage of system development.
- Data Protection Officer (DPO): We will designate a Data Protection Officer responsible for ensuring GDPR compliance and providing guidance on privacy matters within the organization.

## Risks and Mitigations:

- Complexity: Implementing GDPR compliance measures can introduce complexity into our systems. We will mitigate this risk by carefully documenting and automating compliance processes where possible.
- Resource Requirements: GDPR compliance efforts may require additional resources. We will allocate resources, budget, and training to ensure compliance is achievable and sustainable.

## Conclusion:
Ensuring GDPR compliance in our data processing activities is not only a legal requirement but also a commitment to safeguarding individuals' privacy rights. By incorporating these GDPR compliance measures into our data architecture, we demonstrate our dedication to data protection and privacy, reducing the risk of legal penalties and reputational damage while building trust with our customers and users.
