# API Standard implementation

## Decision

- We aim for an API standard that makes it easy for us to build a system that provides better responsiveness and usability for our web and 
mobile apps. 

## Pros:

- REST leverages the standard HTTP protocol, which is widely supported and well-understood and can map REST operations to familiar HTTP methods (simplicity)
- REST is often considered more interoperable because it uses standard HTTP methods and can be easily consumed by a wide range of client libraries and tools (interoperability)
- REST's stateless nature and resource-centric design make it well-suited for building scalable systems (scalability)

## Cons:


## Justification:

- REST API take a more resource oriented approach and is an architectural style that favors scalability and interoperability and
therefore is dynamic in nature. Instead RPC-oriented solutions revolve around methods exposed to the clients API, and usually are statically 
defined ahead of time by some IDL.
