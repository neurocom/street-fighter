# API Standard implementation

## Decision

Web and mobile apps communicate with the system services to fetch and mutate data. Service APIs determine the interoperability between services and the apps. 


So, it becomes essential to choose the right API standard to support the use-cases and provide better responsiveness and usability of the apps.

REST API take a more resource oriented approach

# Pros:

- REST leverages the standard HTTP protocol, which is widely supported and well-understood (simplicity)
- REST is often considered more interoperable because it uses standard HTTP methods and can be easily consumed by a wide range of client libraries and tools (interoperability)
REST's stateless nature and resource-centric design make it well-suited for building scalable systems
